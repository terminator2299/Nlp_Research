# NLP Research Repository

This repository serves as a space for my experiments and research into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other NLP techniques. My goal is to explore various models and implementations to evaluate their effectiveness in different scenarios.

## Purpose
I aim to try multiple models and approaches to determine which is optimal for specific NLP tasks. This includes testing different retrieval methods, embedding techniques, and model architectures to gain insights into their performance.

## Future Work
- Expanding the scope of document extraction techniques.
- Evaluating the efficiency of different retrieval mechanisms.
- Comparing various fine-tuning strategies for generative models.

---
This repository is a work in progress, and I will continue updating it as I explore new approaches.
